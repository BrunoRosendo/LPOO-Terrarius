# LPOO_34 - Terrarius

### Description
An open-world adventure terrarius where our hero must defeat enemies to unlock new areas and unlock new more powerful tools.
In this pseudo-random infinitely generated world our hero will have to deal with different enemies by either slaying them or
by manipulating the world with the powers to break and place blocks. As the player progresses more
challenging enemies will appear and the tools at the disposal of the hero will evolve and improve.
