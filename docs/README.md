#LPOO_34 - Terraria

[PROJECT DESCRIPTION]

##Implemented Features
[WRITE HERE WHAT YOU IMPLEMENT IN CONTROLLER/VIEWERS]

**Element drawing** - Each element of the game is drawn with its own
image, represented by characters and saved in text files

##Planned Features
[WRITE HERE WHAT WE WILL DO AFTER THE FIRST DELIVERY]

##Design
[WRITE THERE EACH TIME YOU HAVE TO SOLVE A PROBLEM]

###Elements Stats

####Problem in context

There were some classes (namely, items and enemies) who had
a lot of primitives all related to its stats. This is a smell
called **primitive obsession**

####The Pattern
To solve this problem, for each class falling in these circumstances,
we created a Stats class which stores all the primitives for the relevant
information

####Implementation
This is an implementation of the *Replace Type Code with Class* refactoring

Below, there's a diagram showing how this was done in the code


The relevant classes for this pattern can be found in the following files:

- [Enemy](https://github.com/FEUP-LPOO-2021/lpoo-2021-g34/blob/master/src/main/java/Model/elements/enemies/Enemy.java)

- [EnemyStats](https://github.com/FEUP-LPOO-2021/lpoo-2021-g34/blob/master/src/main/java/Model/elements/enemies/EnemyStats.java)

- [Tool](https://github.com/FEUP-LPOO-2021/lpoo-2021-g34/blob/master/src/main/java/Model/items/tools/Tool.java)

- [ToolStats](https://github.com/FEUP-LPOO-2021/lpoo-2021-g34/blob/master/src/main/java/Model/items/tools/ToolStats.java)

- [Food](https://github.com/FEUP-LPOO-2021/lpoo-2021-g34/blob/master/src/main/java/Model/items/food/Food.java)

- [FoodStats](https://github.com/FEUP-LPOO-2021/lpoo-2021-g34/blob/master/src/main/java/Model/items/food/FoodStats.java)

####Consequences
The use of this pattern allows for:
- The model classes don't become overflowed by primitives, becoming more
readable and smaller
  
- By grouping all the stats to one class we can have all the stat generation
together, making it easier to change, for example, how much health a zombie 
has, according to its level
  
- We have one more class per type of game element, but that's reasonable when
taking into consideration the quantity of their subclasses, saving us a lot of lines

However, this also adds another code smell, **Data class**, since all
these Stats classes are mainly or only composed by primitives and their
getters/setters. Even with this problem, we believe it's worth it to use
the pattern.


###Constructors with Template Methods

####Problem in Context
We had some abstract classes with attributes which are only defined
by their subclasses. Having that attribute in all the subclasses would
inflict against **The Release Reuse Equivalency Principle**, since we
would be writing almost identical in each subclass

####The Pattern
To solve this problem, we used the **Form Template Method** refactoring
to each class falling under this circumstances. This way, we only have the
relevant attributes in the abstract class and use abstract methods (which will
be overridden in the subclasses) to initialize/calculate those

####Implementation
The following image shows how this pattern can be implemented in each class:


Below, we're linking the classes where this was applied:

- [Enemy](https://github.com/FEUP-LPOO-2021/lpoo-2021-g34/blob/master/src/main/java/Model/elements/enemies/Enemy.java)
- [Block](https://github.com/FEUP-LPOO-2021/lpoo-2021-g34/blob/master/src/main/java/Model/elements/blocks/Block.java)
- [Item](https://github.com/FEUP-LPOO-2021/lpoo-2021-g34/blob/master/src/main/java/Model/items/Item.java)

**Design Patterns**

1. Model-View-Controller
    * MVC is a software design pattern commonly used to develop user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements (Model, View, Controller).
 
2. Factory Method
   * Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.


**Code Smells**

1. Primitive Obsession
   * Signs: Use of primitives instead of small objects for simple tasks.
   * Refactor: Replace Data Value with Object.

2. Duplicate Code
   * Signs: Two code fragments look almost identical.
   * Refactor: Form Template Method.
